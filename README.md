# Attendance Vision

## Introduction

For one of my college classes, I was responsible for taking student attendance using a printed checklist sheet, then manually entering the data into a Google Sheet for the professor.

To automate this repetitive task, I built **Attendance Vision** â€” a computer vision tool powered by a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. It takes an image of an attendance column, detects which checkboxes are marked, and automatically writes the results to a Google Sheet.

## Requirements


## Input
The input to the CNN is a 128x4096 image of a column containing attendance checkboxes:
